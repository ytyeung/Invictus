Cantonese Acoustic Model
(C) DSP and Speech Technology Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong

This is a monophone Cantonese acoustic model, based on Jyutping of the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong  (LSHK). Each state is trained with 32 Gaussian mixtures. The model is trained with HTK 3.4.1. The corpus for training is CUSENT, also developed in our laboratory.

Generally speaking, you may use the model for non-commerical, academic or personal use.

See COPYRIGHT for the details of the lisense.

If you would like to use the model and/or the CUSENT corpus for commerical applications or development, please contact Professor Tan LEE for appropriate
